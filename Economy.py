## Randomized Economy
## In this model one formulates economy by way of potential power,
## versus actual power given per individual (randomized)
## A valuation indexing in placed on this.
## A valuation indexing is an independent indexing mechanism, meaning
## it could be likely known to all, but not necessarily applied
## to something like gdp in 'fair' indexing of an output economy.
## The idea is to have a true independent tangible productivity
## output metric with respect to a given society's social labor.

## Valuation indexing is produced from functional and relative
## relation to a civilization type.

## The idea here is in describing relational differences between output
## power.  In one view a collective of type 1 civilizations more likely
## having economic homogeneity may more likely have similar indexing
## measures in so far as power output.  On the other hand, mixtures
## of civilization types are likely to produce power valuation differences.
## Logically this occurs, for instance, when differences in product
## manufacturing is accorded because of technological differences between
## type civilizations.  For instance, manual smithing labor is replaced
## by mechanized smithing labor which may accord less indexing value to the
## manual form of it, unless it is given to some valued specialization
## ranging outside of mechanization metrics.  There is something also
## arbitrary by this as well.  Consider 'artisanal' classification at times
## given to relativistic range in differences say between present day
## economies and then turn of the century changes in industry which
## would lead to converse valuation differences applied relative to today's
## standards.  In other words, micro batch brewing could be valued today
## much higher for effective 'power' output labor relative to previous
## decades.  

## I use the word 'power' not as in the physics based definition
## but is a general characteristic in defining a product/service
## relation in the abstract.  This is not to be equated with say
## biological caloric power output, but given to valuation for any
## output irrespective of the physical input energy required.  
## This is to say a customer service rep has an associated power output
## that could be equivalent to the manual labor of a contractor, which is
## equivalent to something else and so forth.

## Unfortunately this does contend with some potential mathematical biasing
## as well.  For instance, I have delineated where arbitrarily mechanics
## in valuation indexing may functionally change over time.

## One particular biasing that I may likely include is one that factors
## technological growth over time.  New technologies may at times have
## valuation displacing effects in culture until particular growth saturations
## have resulted...that is where product of manufacturing is commonplace,
## over time and having resulted in social effects leads to at times
## mitigations of valuation differentials.  For instance, mass production
## of common place 'beers' leads to the effect of improved valuations
## by small quantity production products.

## There are also added mitigating factors, the higher the type level of
## a civilization, and the higher the differences between type civilizations
## may have mitigating factors over time in devaluation indexing for lower
## type civilizations over time.

## Functional indexing methods.
## Starts with world based assessment measures.
## First analysis starts with deviation between maximal and minimal civilization
## types.  This leads me to consider time allocation between civilization types.
## Mature civilization types are obviously one given to lengthier time
## allocation and thus in any civilization type classification are likely
## to produce, in theory, for its classification broader range of products
## relative to similar civilization types that are less mature (over time).
## This imparts higher valuation indexing more likely for its given
## classification if a type civilization relative to another is older.
## There are added problems here, however, in modeling, likely as a civilization
## matures there can be devaluators in the the process, namely where less
## in power (which is equivalent to losses in population) also may lead
## to indexing devaluation.  Loss in populations concurs loss in not only
## in products but potentially loss in relative education used in producing
## such products.  This means loss of cultural transmissions that say might
## have some particular manufacturing method irretrievably lossed indicating
## a loss in the civilizations overall production power.

## Thus functional analysis should likely model the behavior of gain and loss,
## for instance, when neighboring differenced type civilizations have gained
## by process of adaptation a higher order civilization type production methods
## may have simultaneous devaluators applied with loss in old production methods.
## In such analysis, communication matters both with respect communication
## power transmmission between civilization types and the degree of reception
## between such civilizations.  Cultures which receive communication and
## are more adaptive may more likely experience fluxing between and aggregation
## of production methods of another civilization type, while those resistant
## may typically be less receptive and generally be resistant to change.
## Thus type I civilizations may say be potentially receptively resistant
## to certain changes that might not be accorded to between say type 4 and
## type 3 civilizations.

## So this leads potentially to added classifications of a civilization,
## namely 'broadcast' and 'reception' attributes.  Receptivity factorization
## is more often considered with respect to 'relation'  I don't think this
## should be an absolute factor.  Here is why:  A type 1 civilization may
## appreciate type 3 products such as more advanced weapons if it relates
## to the process by which type 1 civilizations adapt such product in their
## own production means.  Thus a fire arm is more likely incorporated
## into type 1 civilization because it relates to 'hunt' production methods.
## On the other hand, a 'cell phone' with no towers in a type 1 civilization
## may prove of little use to a type 1 civilization relative a type 5
## civilization, and furthermore even permitting that type 5 civilization
## in a modern legal context obtained permission to operate 'cell towers'
## in such area may still prove of little viable necessity to a type 1
## if literal communication is often highly localized in terms of necessity.
##  Or why, for instance, exchange and trade between Native Americans between
## European colonist would consist of certain types of technological adoptions
## but resistant to other types of technological adoptions.  One particular
## signicantly bearing adoption were European land use and ownership methods.

## Factorization of transmission and receptivity is given by neighboring
## mapped allocation.  It is also given by how one civilization type
## views another and communicates with such civilization type.  Thus
## ommissions are provided for non communicating civilization types.

## Valuation indexing thus is done for relational purposes, and merely
## re factors how one civilization type views the power of the other.
## Or in other words, this provides translates exchange
## between civilization types.  

## On the one hand I want to decouple the process of power evaluation here,
## since this leads to a tangible measure of the power of a civilization
## type, but on the other hand, it is hard to decouple this also completely
## without considering the civilizations relational measure.  For instance,
## a type 1 or type 2 relatively to other higher order civilization types,
## may more or less exchange between other civilization types on base order
## power.  At least one potential flawed assumption I could see in this,
## is that a non simulated prior state given to randomizing and parametrically
## assigning civilization type to power may not reflect likely accurate
## in reaching such state with previous assignments.
## thus it maybe more wise to initialize all civilization types at the lowest
## order.  Otherwise, it seems one may need to add any number of assuming
## factors in provisioning mixed higher order states in a world system.

## I also see issues here with respect to power and geography likewise, or
## at least I feel compelled in this modeling attempt to factor geography
## in so far as power metrics.  That is, is it viable to say that any population
## of a similar size is viably the same even at the outset in so far as power
## metrics alone in consideration to the productivity yielded from land
## geography alone.  For instance, a densely populated island with fewer
## resources may have lower power yields per person relative to less densely
## populated regions that are richer in resources for a given civilization
## type.

## Economies often value, at present, for instance, land geography in terms
## of resources at the outset likewise especially in consideration to
## its present productivity.

## On the other hand, the simplified assumption is that where ever a
## civilization exists and is initialized assumes viable productivity by some
## measure, but this still leaves ambiguous some power indexing measure.

## Thus I am inclined to describe by measure of power, land geography attributes:
## 'timber', for instance, 'marine', 'land subsistance', 'agriculture',
## 'wildlife', 'mineral', 'water', 'wetlands/marsh' (this particular resource
## actually is a modern one that relates indirectly to water quality).  Higher
## order civilizations may be on the other described in power measurement
## more abstractly from land geography, exepting 'mineral', 'water', 'timber'
## however, these seem less relavant to the broader context of a higher
## order civilization type that is assumed to expand in regional ways,
## dealing with the mitigating factors for land habitation and growth.
## Hmm...okay I am thinking that power should be linked strictly to populations
## alone irrespective of geography.  Then power abstractly gives a sense of
## human population scale as well as potential output, but it doesn't say
## what specific simulated growth will result for a civilization order type.

## Civilization order types may also be decoupled from power itself or power
## inferring potentially a civilization order type given to some maximal
## growth boundary conditions as well as geographical spatial delineations
## likely for a power metric.

## The Roman empire, for instance, would represent a type 3 civilization.
## In 25 B.C. population estimates ranged at 56.8 million people.

## The Aboriginal population of Canada during the late 15th century
## is estimated to have been between 200,000[8] and two million,[9]
## with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted
## by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.
## Represents at times likely type 1 and type 2 civilizations.
## While other parts of MesoAmerica and South America ,
## may have had:
## Using an estimate of approximately 37 million people in 1492
## (including 6 million in the Aztec Empire,
## 8 million in the Mayan States,
## 11 million in what is now Brazil, and 12 million in the Inca Empire) would
## by classified more so in the type 3 category.  Albeit given to differences
## between the Roman empire, namely where limitations in animal husbandry
## and animal based locomotive transport were resulting.  One can see
## potentially already some of mathematical population upper ranges between
## type 1, type 2 and type 3 civilizations here.
## I feel also more inclined to define type 1 groupings neither as
## as a regional aggregation but by a defined locality, as opposed to higher
## order civilizations which would be considered more so by their aggregate
## city/state/populaces form.

## The simplified version of power indexing, however, omits consideration
## of all subsequent specialities that would emerge in higher order
## civilizations, and in stead considers the percentile range of human
## populations devoted to food production.  For higher order civilization
## types the assumption is that the percentile range of those devoted
## to food production declines, and declines dramatically.  Now if
## the available yield of food to sustain such population is metric
## to the power of a civilization, on the other, the equivalent power
## for each individual in sustaining a given population for food production
## if it were theoretically possible increases.  The idea then of measuring
## an economy by power then could be equated to something like the horsepower
## measure.  Where in a type 1 civilization maybe the 90th percentile range
## are devoted to food production, and the power yield is more 1 to 1 with
## respect to food production yields and persons producing.  On the other hand,
## if only 40% of a given population were needed to sustain a given
## population the power yield would be 2.25 times greater than the orginal
## population or the scale factor from the produces for a given population
## a power index of the population * scale factor ratio between a base type
## and its present day food production yields.  On the other a type 5
## civilization (at its maximum) might require 2% of its overall population
## thus giving a scale factor of 45 times a base population size.

## The base order civilization type is a theoretical one, however, that is
## described likely by a maximum of 100% population devoted to food production.
## Type 1 civilization's here, however, may be allocated any degree of variance
## in so far as food production less than this theoretical maximum, but is
## given to ranges that are typically higher than that of type 2 civilizations
## and so forth.

## In a given economy, if it one were to break down area of specilization
## as though it were a commodity, food production is a given product for
## all civilization types, and that its associated cost rank should be 1 to
## 1 equivalent for the per capita maximum.  Which is to say this 
## increases on a 1 to 1 ratio per capita, or costing the equivalent of type 5
## civilization 2% of its population workforce.

## cost example for food production:
## type 3 roman civilization with 31% food production ratio yields a total
## power index of 1.832 billion points of this a base of power cost of
## 56.8 million power points would be necessary
## in meeting food production needs leaving a surplus of 1.775 billion points
## One could, then, use a stratified quantification of points for a civilizations
## attribute specializations based upon these surpluses.  Whereas, in the case,
## of the theoretical no remaining power indexing points remains for anything
## other than food production alone.  Obviously this implictly demonstrates
## some governing measure as to what degree of non directly related food
## production means should exist.  It is important in noting that implicitly
## however, some subsidiary occupation, for instance, might relate to food
## production still even if it is not directly factored into it.
## For instance, an astronomer in a type 2 or even type 1 civilization
## might exist, but
## devotion exists in so far as relating seasonal cycles that relate somehow
## back to food production itself (e.g., when the best time to plant crops,
## or what seasons may be most productive subsistence energy spent and so forth).
## it would be noted that an increase in power indexing costs would suffice
## in some manner to the ordered relation of the civilization type as the
## for the occupational specialty, and that generally it might be expected that
## some manner of progressive expense were allocated to any of the previous
## costs incurred for lower order civilizations for the higher order type.
## At this point I haven't considered any particular cost structure beyond
## its relation to food production alone, but at leasts this establishes
## at a basis a potential relation between the civilization type and its
## profession classified stratifications

## Power indexing and food production per captia statifications
## at this point mine are entirely theoretical and not to be construed
## as realistic in real world earth historical modeling.
