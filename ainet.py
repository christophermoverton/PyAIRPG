## Thinking to make use of Complex bonding procedure with modifications
## Nodes as in the definition of complex, are modified so that defining parent
## child relationships implies probablistic graph inter connectivity between
## parent inter nodal relations to that of the child.

## The same is true in definition to social household nucleus.
## It may be easier to define the Complex then by way of household
## nucleus so that the defined neighbor nodes graph extends from
## single person to an atomic household nucleus.  Wife, and children
## thus by definition are encompassed in this region.
